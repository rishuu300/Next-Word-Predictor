# ðŸ§  Next Word Predictor

**Next Word Predictor** is a machine learning application that leverages an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict the next word in a given sequence of text. Trained on Shakespeare's  *Hamlet* , this model captures the nuances of classical English literature, making it a fascinating tool for exploring language modeling and sequence prediction.

## ðŸš€ Features

* **LSTM-Based Architecture** : Utilizes an LSTM neural network to model and predict sequential data effectively.
* **Streamlit Interface** : Offers an interactive web interface built with Streamlit for seamless user interaction.
* **Pretrained Model** : Comes with a pretrained model on  *Hamlet* , allowing immediate experimentation.
* **Tokenizer Integration** : Employs a tokenizer to preprocess and convert text into sequences suitable for the model.
